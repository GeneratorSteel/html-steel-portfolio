<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Samuel Vazquez. A young designer born in Madrid, Spain. 
  Since I was a kid I've always been fascinated by how funny a monster, an animal, 
  even a person can be... and since I learned how to hold a pencil, 
  I've been drawing and creating my own little monsters,
  superheroes or anything I could imagine.</p>

<p>Once I finished all my schooling and high school I pursued the idea of training in the creation
  of video games, my favorite hobby. For two years I had the pleasure to learn how to design,
  illustrate, animate, model and program professionally and I was even able to show
  my talent in an indie game studio for a while.</p>

<p>A little later I got the opportunity to teach at the center where I learned everything
  I know about design and animation and for two years that's what I did. 
  Mentoring kids so that they could conceive and bring their ideas to fruition.
  Now, fresh from this experience, I have embarked on the journey of training as a programmer to be
  able to work with my father's company, a renowned consultancy here in the province of Malaga.
